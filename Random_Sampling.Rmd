This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

df <- read.csv("C:/Users/nicho/Google Drive/School/Graduate School/Kent State/Spring 2020/Analytics In Practice/NPPES/npidata_pfile.csv", header = TRUE, sep=",", skip=100000, nrows=100000)
```

```{r}
#85 unique geographic areas
length(unique(df[,c("OR.1")]))
```

```{r}
#80,137 distinct names
library(dplyr)
distinct(df, CAMPBELL, R., CLAIRE)
```

```{r}
#We notice duplicates in the DR column
summary(data.frame(duplicated(df[,c("DR.")])))
```

```{r}
library(e1071)
mean(is.na(df))
a <- impute(df, what = c("median"))
head(a)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
